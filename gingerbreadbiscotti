                   <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                   <ul>
                       <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                       <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                       <li>3 eggs</li>
                       <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
                       <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                       <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
                       <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                       <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground ginger</li>
                       <li>3/4 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
                       <li>1/2 tablespoon ground cloves</li>
                       <li>1/4 tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
                   </ul>

                   <h4>Steps</h4>

                   <ol>
                       <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li> <br>
                       <li>In a large bowl, mix together oil, sugar, eggs, and molasses. In another bowl, combine flours, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg; mix into egg mixture to form a stiff dough.</li> <br>
                       <li>Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a roll the length of the cookie. Place rolls on cookie sheet, and pat down to flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness.</li> <br>
                       <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.</li> <br>
                       <li>When cool enough to touch, cut into 1/2 inch thick diagonal slices. Place sliced biscotti on cookie sheet, and bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until toasted and crispy.</li> <br>
                   </ol>
